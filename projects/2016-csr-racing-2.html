        My role: Lead Android Programmer

        I was responsible for leading the Android development on CSR2, a title which had the most successful launch for a
        NaturalMotion game to date. CSR2 can be played on over 3500 Android devices and was well received by players and
        the press for its visuals and gameplay. In order to achieve high rendering performance on all supported devices,
        I developed a device categorisation system to leverage device fragmentation to our advantage and to lay a
        foundation for our LOD system. This system has proven to be robust yet extensible enough to cater for new
        devices released since launch.
