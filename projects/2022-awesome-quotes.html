    <h1>Awesome Quotes</h1>
    <p>
        My role: Design, Programming, Project Management and Publishing 
    </p>
    <p>Awesome Quotes is a self-published mobile app built around an infinite scroll paging
        mechanism to present uplifting quotes and images.
    </p>
    <p>I built Awesome Quotes as a vehicle for teaching how to create mobile apps using React.
        It is fully data-driven, with data pulled from ZenQuotes and Pexels APIs.
